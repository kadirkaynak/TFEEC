Points to be considered while marking are included in this guide.

1) Read the entire text.
2) If there is a problem with the text, move on to the other text.
3) For each sentence:
    a) Identify event triggers.
    b) Identify scopes of triggers. (Triggers can consist of a single word, or they can consist of more than one independent words!)
    c) For each trigger:
        I) Determine the event type and subtype. (The event type and subtype must be one of the options available in the ontology!)
        II) Identify the arguments for the event. (If any...)
        III) Determine the scope of the arguments. (Arguments can be made up of a single word or consecutive words!)
        IV) For each argument:
            1) Identify the types of arguments. (The event argument must be one of the options available in the ontology!)
            2) Add reference link from event trigger to event arguments.
            3) Review label fields, complete if missing.
        VI) Review label fields, complete if missing.
4) Re-read the article, check your markups and tags, make edits where necessary.

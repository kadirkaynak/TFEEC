<center><h1>TFEEC : TURKISH FINANCIAL EVENT EXTRACTION CORPUS</h1></center> 

### Dataset for Turkish Financial Event Extraction
We present a dataset that will enable the extraction of financial and economic events from Turkish news. For this study, we collected company-specific news articles shared on www.borsagundem.com between 2010-2022. A total of 34,746 news articles were collected, of which 600 were hand-marked and the remaining 34,146 were automatically tagged using weak supervision methods.

In order to contribute to future studies in this field, our dataset is open to everyone.
